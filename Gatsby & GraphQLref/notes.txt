All my notes on the Gatsby Coffee Shop Website Video is in this file. 4hrs in length.
-Close you eyes and imagine what's going on. This way I'll understand sooner and  further drill web dev skills with repetition into my subconsious mechenism.
  - The dude is using state with Gatsby for programming purposes. I might as well use it too.
  - You can add states to className. E.g. className={this.state.css} and whatever the is css="" to in state is what will be filled into that spot.

Example of turning something on and off:
  navbarHandler = () => {
    this.state.navbarOpen
    ? this.setState({ navbarOpen: false, css: "collapse navbar-collapse" })
    : this.setState({
      navbarOpen: true,
      css: "collapse navbar-collapse show"
    });
  };

What you can do in Sass:
:root {
  --mainBrown: #232322;
  --mainYellow: #232322;
  --mainWhite: #232322;
}
body {
  background: var(--mainWhite);
  color: var(--mainDark);
}
