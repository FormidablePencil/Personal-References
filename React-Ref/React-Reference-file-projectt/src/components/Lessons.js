//!*? List and keys:

//* Below, we loop through the numbers array using the JavaScript map() function. We return a <li> element for each item. Finally, we assign the resulting array of elements to listItems:
class Lesson extends react.component { 
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>  //! you would put keys in tags/elements <li 'here' ></li> 
<li key={number.toString()}>{number}</li>  //* The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings. Most often you would use IDs from your data as keys: <li key={todo.id}> When you donâ€™t have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last resort: // Only do this if items have no stable IDs <li key={index}></li>
);
  render(){
    return(
      <div>
        <ul>{listItems}</ul>,             {/* //* listItem is a variable we've easily plopped into <ul> and listItem contains the whole list of <li>'s */}
      </div>

    )
  }
  
}

ReactDOM.render( Lesson,
  document.getElementById('root')

//!*? Keys Must Only Be Unique Among Siblings

  const sidebar = (
    <ul>
      {props.posts.map((post) =>
        <li key={post.id}>

//* Forms in Html 

<form>
  <label>
    Name:
    <input type="text" name="name" />
  </label>

//* vs React. Called Controlled Components

class NameForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {value: ''};

    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
  }

  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({value: event.target.value});                                     //* This event handler sets the state of value to what has been changed/typed in the element that activated this function from onChange. event.target.value means the value of what element was triggered.
  }

  handleSubmit(event) {
    alert('A name was submitted: ' + this.state.value);                     //* Since handleChange runs on every keystroke to update the React state (that's what an onChange event does), the displayed value will update as the user types.
    event.preventDefault();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>                              {/* //* To prevent the default behavior of onSubmit, we would have to "attach" an event handler that prevents the default behavior. */}
        <label>
          Name:
          <input type="text" value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange} />         {/* //* In React, forms must not have their own state (it may not even work). So here we've told React to go get the 'value' from state and when onChange then fire a fuction that updates the state. */}
        </label>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
      </form>
    );
  }
}

//* With a controlled component, every state mutation will have an associated handler function. This makes it straightforward to modify or validate user input. For example, if we wanted to enforce that names are written with all uppercase letters, we could write handleChange as:
handleChange(event) {
  this.setState({value: event.target.value.toUpperCase()});
}
